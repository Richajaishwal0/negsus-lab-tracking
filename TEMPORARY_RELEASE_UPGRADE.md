## Overview
Successfully upgraded the temporary release feature from hourly-based releases to full-day calendar-based releases with enhanced user experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend Model Updates
- **File**: `server/models/temporaryRelease.js`
- **Changes**: 
  - Replaced `releaseStartDate`, `releaseEndDate`, `releaseStartTime`, `releaseEndTime` with `releaseDates[]` array
  - Now stores array of Date objects for selected release dates
  - Simplified structure for full-day releases only

### 2. Backend API Updates
- **File**: `server/routes/temporaryReleases.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `/create` endpoint to accept `releaseDates` array instead of individual date/time fields
  - Enhanced validation to check all release dates are within booking period
  - Updated conflict detection for date arrays
  - Fixed authentication middleware references

### 3. Booking Conflict Detection
- **File**: `server/routes/bookings.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated conflict detection logic to work with date arrays
  - Generates all dates in requested period and checks coverage
  - Maintains temporary booking linking functionality

### 4. Frontend API Service
- **File**: `client/src/services/api.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `createTemporaryRelease` to use new data structure
  - Changed endpoint from `/temporary-releases` to `/temporary-releases/create`
  - Simplified data interface

### 5. Frontend UI Upgrade
- **File**: `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Major Changes**:
  - Replaced DatePicker/TimePicker with Material-UI DateCalendar
  - Added calendar-based date selection interface
  - Implemented multi-date selection with visual feedback
  - Added date validation within booking period
  - Updated temporary releases table display
  - Enhanced user experience with chips for selected dates

## ðŸš€ New Features

### Calendar Interface
- **Visual Calendar**: Users see a full calendar view
- **Date Range Restriction**: Only dates within booking period are selectable
- **Multi-Selection**: Users can select multiple non-consecutive dates
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected dates are highlighted and shown as chips
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar updates immediately on selection

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Simplified Flow**: No time selection needed - full day releases only
- **Clear Instructions**: Users understand they're releasing entire days
- **Booking Context**: Shows original booking period for reference
- **Validation**: Prevents invalid date selections

### Improved Data Structure
- **Flexible**: Can handle any number of non-consecutive dates
- **Efficient**: Single record can represent complex release patterns
- **Clear**: Date arrays are easier to understand and process

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Database Schema
```javascript
// Old Schema
{
  releaseStartDate: Date,
  releaseEndDate: Date,
  releaseStartTime: String,
  releaseEndTime: String
}

// New Schema
{
  releaseDates: [Date]  // Array of release dates
}
```

### API Interface
```javascript
// Old API Call
createTemporaryRelease({
  bookingId: "123",
  releaseStartDate: "2025-08-10",
  releaseEndDate: "2025-08-12",
  releaseStartTime: "09:00",
  releaseEndTime: "17:00",
  reason: "Out of town"
})

// New API Call
createTemporaryRelease({
  bookingId: "123",
  releaseDates: ["2025-08-10", "2025-08-11", "2025-08-12"],
  reason: "Out of town"
})
```

### Conflict Detection Logic
```javascript
// Old Logic: Check date range overlap
releaseStart <= bookingStart && releaseEnd >= bookingEnd

// New Logic: Check all dates covered
requestDates.every(date => releaseDateStrings.includes(date))
```

## ðŸ“± User Interface Updates

### Before (Time-based)
- Date start/end pickers
- Time start/end pickers
- Complex validation
- Confusing hourly selections

### After (Calendar-based)
- Visual calendar interface
- Click to select/deselect dates
- Chip display of selected dates
- Full-day releases only
- Intuitive and user-friendly

## âœ… Testing & Validation

- **Conflict Detection**: âœ… Logic handles date arrays properly
- **Frontend Build**: âœ… No compilation errors
